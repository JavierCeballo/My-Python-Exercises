# My repository

Hello, my name is Javier Ceballo, and I'm learning Python. In this repository, I share my solution to some exercises proposed in the book *The Python Workbook - A brief introduction with exercises and solutions* by Ben Stephenson.

I use these exercises to practice what I have learned about Python language.

Thanks for reading! â˜º
